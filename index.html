      <p>Ecuador, located in South America, is named after the equator, which runs through it, making it the "Middle of the World." The Mitad del Mundo Monument, near Quito, marks this unique spot and stands 30 meters (98 feet) tall with a museum inside showcasing Ecuadorian culture and history. However, GPS technology later revealed that the true equator lies a few hundred meters away, where the IntiÃ±an Museum offers interactive experiments demonstrating gravitational and magnetic effects at the equator. Despite this, the monument remains a major tourist attraction, symbolizing Ecuadorâ€™s special geographical position.</p>
